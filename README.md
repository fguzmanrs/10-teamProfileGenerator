# Team Profile Generator

## User Story

AS A manager 
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info 
SO THAT I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

## Business Context

## Team Profile Generator works as follows

* The user will run the application (app.js) using Node.js.
* The user will be prompted to input the number of employees
* For each employee, the user will input the employee name, email, position, etc.
* The application will generate an HTML page and pdf preview of the web page.

<!-- * Refer to GIF below for an app demo.

<!-- * Example of team profile as a PDF

<!-- * Try it our at: https://fguzmanrs.github.io/14-teamProfileGenerator/ -->
